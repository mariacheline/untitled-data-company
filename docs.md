#### Writing a Blog Post

Every blog post needs a Front Matter which contains:
- ***title:*** blog's title.
- ***categories:*** categories which the blog belongs to, this is not mandatory, you can add categories as you please.
              More than one category requres brackets around, separated by commas: `[category, hehe]`.
- ***subtitle:*** appears on the sub info on the card display of the blog entry.
- ***thumbnail:*** appears on the card's image of the blog entry, as well as on the banner of the blog's post.
